# MediaManagement
This is a personal project to help me learn Python and GitHub.<br>
This codebase is intended for managing media files and metadata.<br><br>

This project is in a very early draft stage. Many methods and functions will likely need to be modified, and the code will likely need refactoring.<br><br>

The "Handler" and "Manager" scripts are classes and methods that provide the core functionality.<br>
The "Support functions" are scripts that provide additional functions to support the main classes.<br>
The "Process" scripts will contain the functions for the user to perform tasks to manage the files/metadata.
