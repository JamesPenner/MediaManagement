# MediaManagement
This is a personal project to help me learn Python and GitHub.
This codebase is intended for managing media files and metadata.

This project is in a very early draft stage. Many methods and functions will likely need to be modified, and the code will likely need refactoring.

The "Handler" and "Manager" scripts are classes and methods that provide the core functionality.
The "Support functions" are scripts that provide additional functions to support the main classes.
The "Process" scripts will contain the functions for the user to perform tasks to manage the files/metadata
